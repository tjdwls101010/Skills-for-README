## 1. Overview

The OpenAI [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) is a capable coding agent, but running it from inside another tool exposes a real gap: `codex exec resume` has no `--sandbox` flag. A resumed turn doesn't inherit the sandbox its thread was created with — it silently re-derives one from whatever config layer happens to be active at that moment. Measured directly:

| Turn | Command | `turn_context.sandbox_policy` | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `codex exec --ignore-user-config -c sandbox_mode="read-only"` | `read-only` | write refused |
| 2 | `codex exec resume <id>` (user config inherited, no flag passed) | **`danger-full-access`** | **file written** |

It breaks in the opposite direction too: a `workspace-write` thread resumed under isolation with no flag silently *downgrades* to `read-only`, and its reasoning-effort setting disappears along with it. The full measurement, including that downgrade, is in [Sandbox Stability](docs/wiki/Sandbox-Stability.md).

**Codex in Claude** is a Claude Code plugin that closes that gap, and in doing so turns the Codex CLI into something Claude can actually delegate real work to: a background subagent whose settings stay stable across turns. It's for anyone using Claude Code who wants a second model (Codex, running on GPT) working in parallel — checked in on through a filtered live log instead of a wall of raw output, stoppable and redirectable mid-task, and resumable later, including threads that were started directly in the Codex TUI.

It isn't a thin wrapper around the `codex` binary. Every per-invocation setting — sandbox, model, reasoning effort, isolation, working directory — is recorded the moment a run starts and re-injected on every subsequent call. That's what makes "safe to resume" a guarantee instead of a hope.

## 2. Features

- **Background by default** — `start` returns a `run_id`/`thread_id` immediately instead of blocking; check back in whenever it's convenient.
- **Sandbox stability across turns** — every `resume` re-asserts the sandbox, model, and reasoning effort its thread was created with. See [Sandbox Stability](docs/wiki/Sandbox-Stability.md).
- **Your Codex defaults survive isolation** — `--ignore-user-config` drops `config.toml` whole, so an isolated run would lose the model, reasoning effort and Fast mode you configured and take the server's defaults instead. Three keys are read back out of the file and re-injected; an explicit flag still wins, and a resumed thread re-asserts what it recorded rather than what the file says now. `sandbox_mode` is deliberately not one of them. See [CLI Reference](docs/wiki/CLI-Reference.md).
- **A filtered live event log** — four verbosity levels (`compact` by default, `normal`, `full`, `raw`), with the default chosen from real measurements rather than a guess. See [Context Discipline & Event Log Levels](docs/wiki/Context-Discipline.md).
- **Stop, then redirect** — interrupt a run mid-task and continue it on the same thread with new instructions. `stop` always targets a run's own process group, never a process by name, so concurrent runs never interfere with each other.
- **Resume any thread** — including ones started outside this plugin, directly in the Codex TUI.
- **Schema-validated results** — pass `--schema` and get back parsed, validated JSON instead of a message you have to eyeball.
- **A deadline you choose** — `--timeout` works in the background and records a state of its own, so "it ran out of the time I gave it" never reads as "Codex failed". The thread stays resumable across it.
- **Run several as one group** — `batch start` launches N runs under one name; `status --group`, `result --group`, and `stop --group` then address all of them at once. Members share your tree by default, the way a fan-out of Claude's own subagents does; `--worktree` gives each writing member its own git checkout when they would edit the same files. Chain a next phase onto a group with `--resume-from`, and add `--as-ready` to start each member as soon as the one it continues is done rather than waiting for the slowest. See [Orchestration](docs/wiki/Orchestration.md).
- **Built-in diagnostics** — `doctor` checks your PATH, Codex auth, config, and the run registry in a single call.

## 3. Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) — verified against `0.147.0`, already authenticated (`codex login`)
- Python 3.10+ — standard library only, no extra packages to install
- Claude Code 2.1.220 or later

**Install the plugin**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add tjdwls101010/Codex-in-Claude
claude plugin install codex@codex-in-claude
```

Confirm it's active — `claude plugin list` should show `codex` with `Status: ✔ enabled`.

<details>
<summary>Installing from a local checkout, or without the plugin marketplace</summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/Codex-in-Claude
claude plugin install codex@codex-in-claude
```

Or, for development, symlink the skill directly:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/Codex-in-Claude/.claude/skills/codex ~/.claude/skills/codex
```

A symlinked skill doesn't get the plugin's pre-approved `allowed-tools`, so every poll prompts for approval. Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json` to get the same effect manually — **with your own absolute path written out**:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Skill(codex)",
      "Bash(python3 \"/Users/you/.claude/skills/codex/scripts/codex_bridge.py\" *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Both lines are load-bearing, and both were measured in a headless session running in the default permission mode:

- **`$HOME` is not expanded in a permission rule.** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is (that is what makes the plugin install work with no settings at all), but `$HOME` is not, so a rule written with it never matches and every bridge call is refused. Write the path out.
- **`Skill(codex)` is separate from the bridge rule.** Without it the skill cannot even load, so the `Bash(...)` rule is never reached — the session simply reports that the skill failed and does nothing.

</details>

**First run**

Inside a Claude Code session, just describe the work — the skill triggers automatically on phrasing like "codex", "GPT", or "delegate this to Codex", or you can invoke it explicitly with `/codex:codex`. The first time it loads, Claude's context will include a line like `Base directory for this skill: <dir>` — that's the path to use for every command below.

As a sanity check, ask Claude to run:

```bash
python3 "<base directory>/scripts/codex_bridge.py" doctor
```

`doctor` exits `0` when Codex is reachable, authenticated, and configured correctly, or `2` with a `blockers` array explaining exactly what to fix.

From there, a typical loop looks like this (`$CODEX` below is shorthand for the full `python3 "<base directory>/scripts/codex_bridge.py"`):

```bash
$CODEX start --label refactor "Refactor the auth module to use the new session store"
# → {"run_id": "...", "thread_id": "...", "state": "running", ...}

$CODEX status --run <run_id>
# → elapsed/idle time, usage, and the last thing the agent said

$CODEX result --run <run_id>
# → the final message and usage, once it's done
```

See [Getting Started](docs/wiki/Getting-Started.md) for a fuller walkthrough, and [CLI Reference](docs/wiki/CLI-Reference.md) for every subcommand and flag.

## 4. Usage

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `start` | New thread. Background by default; returns `{run_id, thread_id}` immediately |
| `resume` | Add a turn to an existing thread; every recorded setting is re-asserted |
| `status` | State, elapsed/idle time, usage, last message, in-progress item |
| `log` | Filtered events, delivered incrementally via `--since <cursor>` |
| `show` | One item's full output, fetched on request |
| `stop` | Interrupt by process group — never by matching a process name |
| `result` | Final message, usage, and parsed JSON when `--schema` was used |
| `batch start` | N runs as one named group, sharing your tree unless `--worktree` gives each writing member a checkout |
| `batch clean` | Remove a finished group's worktrees, once you've collected them |
| `doctor` | PATH, version, `CODEX_HOME`, auth, config sandbox, registry health, worktrees |

`status`, `result` and `stop` also take `--group <name>` to address a whole batch at once.

Defaults: background execution, `workspace-write` sandbox, isolated from your own Codex config (`--ignore-user-config`) apart from the three keys above, no hard timeout.

By default, a command's actual output never reaches Claude's context — only its size does:

```
cmd[item_2] exit=0 out=8797B rg -n "" tests . --glob '*.py'
```

Fetch that one command's full output on demand with `show --item item_2`. See [Context Discipline & Event Log Levels](docs/wiki/Context-Discipline.md) for the reasoning and the measurements behind it.

To interrupt a run that's going the wrong way and redirect it without losing its progress:

```bash
$CODEX stop --run <run_id>
$CODEX resume <run_id> "Stop rewriting tests — just fix the failing assertion"
```

To hand three independent pieces of work to three Codex runs at once and collect them as one thing:

```bash
$CODEX batch start --group audit --task "audit the parser" --task "audit the lexer" --task "audit the cache"
$CODEX status --group audit --follow      # ends on a terminal line, never in silence
$CODEX result --group audit               # each message, plus which paths more than one wrote
$CODEX batch clean --group audit          # only if you asked for worktrees
```

Members work in your tree, the way a fan-out of your own subagents does: their changes are there as they make them, with nothing to collect. Add `--worktree` when they would edit the same files, and each writing member gets its own checkout instead. See [Orchestration](docs/wiki/Orchestration.md).

## 6. Project Status

Codex in Claude is at **v0.7.0** — an early, actively developed release, verified against `codex-cli 0.149.1` and Claude Code `2.1.246`. Its documented behaviors (background execution, sandbox stability, context filtering, batch orchestration, worktree isolation, and more) are validated against real Codex runs and real headless Claude sessions, not just the fake test shim — see [Testing](docs/wiki/Testing.md) for how.

**Upgrading from v0.1.0?** Two removals are breaking: the `SessionEnd` cleanup hook (and `--detach` with it) and `stop --all-mine`. Background runs are no longer stopped when a session ends — `status --all` finds them and `stop --run <id>`/`stop --all` ends them, and `doctor` now reports what the registry is holding. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md#020--2026-08-02).

A few things are deliberately out of scope for now, not overlooked: `codex cloud`, `codex mcp-server`/`app-server` integration, and true mid-turn steering. See [Overview → Non-Goals](docs/wiki/Overview.md#5-non-goals) for why.
